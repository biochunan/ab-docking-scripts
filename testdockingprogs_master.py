Description:
============
This program takes a PDB file containing the structure of an antibody/antigen complex as input, splits the file into its component chains, runs these chains through a docking algorithm, then evaluates the result using the ProFit program. The docking and evaluation steps are repeated for each docking algorithm specified.
